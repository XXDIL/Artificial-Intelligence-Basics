## Basic AI simulation using 2 different types of path finding.

1) Informed Goal (part a)
2) Uninformed Goal (part b and c)

In part a the agent knows the goal co-ordinates, and he is spawned at random location. Therefore it finds its way quite efficiently.

------

In part b the agent is unaware of the exact goal co-ordinates, but has a sensor that tells him how far away from the goal it is at a given point of time. Therefore adding a sense of randomness in its movement.


------

In part c, it is quite similar to part b but in this case there are 10 agents that are simultaniousy moving towards the goal. Just for the fun of it.
